	* src/drv_imap.c:

	fix CVE-2013-0289: add SSL subject verification

	we did not check a valid certificate's subject at all so far.
	this is no problem if the certificate file contains only exactly the
	wanted host's certificate - before revision 04fdf7d1 (dec 2000, < v0.4),
	this was even enforced (more or less - if the peer cert had been
	signed directly by a root cert, it would be accepted as well).
	however, when the file contains root certificates (like the system-wide
	certificate file typically does), any host with a valid certificate
	could pretend to be the wanted host.

2012-04-28 10:10  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in:

	disable debian stuff when shadow-building

	the stuff needs to be run in the source dir and modifies it, which is a

2010-10-03 09:53  Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>

	* src/drv_imap.c:

	don't hang after failed start_tls()

	we'd send a LOGOUT command in plain text while the server was already

	so close the socket immediately instead of letting the normal shutdown
	path take care of it.

	* .cvsignore, config.c, imap.c, isync.1, isync.h, maildir.c,
	  main.c, sync.c:

	Bunch 'o patches from Oswald Buddenhagen:

	i implemented some cool stuff (tm).
	first, the long missing "create server-side missing mailboxes". -C now
	creates both local and remote boxes; -L and -R create only local/remote.
	second, i implemented a 1:1 remote:local folder mapping (-1) with an
	optional INBOX exception (inbox/-I). the remote folder is specified with
	the folder keyword (or -F switch) and takes precedence over the
	namespace setting. the local directory with the mailboxes can now be
	specified on the command line, too (-M).

	another patch:
	- made the -1 switch settable permanently (OneToOne). after all, you
	  usually define your mailbox layout once forever. removed -A, as it is
	  semantically -a modified by -1.
	- cleaned up message output a bit. still, the quiet variable should be
	  used throughout the program. at best, create some generic output
	  function, which obeys a global verbosity level variable.
	- optimized + cleaned up configuration parser slightly
	- minor cleanups

	add an (almost) unique id to every uploaded message and search for it
	right after. i thought about using the message-id, but a) it is not
	guaranteed to be unique in a mailbox (imagine you edit a mail and store
	the dupe in the same box) and b) some mails (e.g., postponed) don't even
	have one. a downside of the current implementation is, that this
	id-header remains in the mailbox, but given that it wastes only 27 bytes
	per mail and removing it would mean several roundtrips more, this seems
	acceptable.
	i changed the line-counting loop to use a mmapped file instead of
	reading it in chunks, as it makes things simpler and is probably even
	faster for big mails.
	the amount of goto statements in my code may be scary, but c is simply
	lacking a multi-level break statement. :)

	this is the "shut up" patch. :) it makes the -q option consequent, so to
	say.
	additionally it adds an -l option which gathers all defined/found
	mailboxes and just outputs the list. don't ask what i need it for. ;)

2002-10-30 02:01  Michael Elkins <me@mutt.org>

		- use socketpair() to create one full-duplex fd in tunnel mode
		  instead of two half-duplex pipes

		- use F_SETLK instead of F_SETLKW to avoid infinite waiting
		- use "$@" in autogen.sh to get proper word expansion

2002-06-21 00:26  Michael Elkins <me@mutt.org>

	* configure.in, isync.h:

	* Makefile.am, dotlock.c, dotlock.h, maildir.c:

	remove debian/files

	move dotlocking code to dotlock.c.

	dotlocking code fixed to ignore whether or not the lockfile exists on
	open().  we only care about whether fcntl() was able to lock it.

	* sync.c:

	Don't bother uploaded messages marked deleted when we are going to expunge.

	optimize db fetch/store to not copy the base filename

2002-01-16 19:47  Michael Elkins <me@mutt.org>

	* config.c, configure.in, cram.c, imap.c, isync.1, isync.h,
	  list.c, maildir.c, main.c, sync.c:

	updated year in copyright notice

	the uid for each message in the maildir is now stored in a dbm database
	rather than the filename.  this change was necessary because isync became
	confused if you copied a message to another folder, in which case the uid
	was invalid.

	as a result of the above change, isync now acquires a mutex on the mailbox
	to protect the dbm database from concurrent access.

	main() was reworked to continue gracefully when an error is encountered, and
	to always call maildir_close() so that the lock can be disabled, and the
	database closed.

2001-11-20 18:28  Michael Elkins <me@mutt.org>

	* Makefile.am, isync.spec.in:

	post 0.7-release commit

2001-11-13 00:36  Michael Elkins <me@mutt.org>

	* config.c, sync.c:

	strndup() could return a non-NULL terminated string

	when expending tildes (~), an extra slash was inserted after the user's home
	directory

2001-11-12 23:03  Michael Elkins <me@mutt.org>

	* isync.h, maildir.c, main.c:

	merge maildir_sync() and maildir_close().  the maxuid in a maildir still
	needs to be updated in --fast mode, and the sync code already checks to see
	if any changes were made to the mailbox.

2001-11-09 00:35  Michael Elkins <me@mutt.org>

	* README:

	add FreeBSD to the list of tested platforms

2001-10-03 06:15  Michael Elkins <me@mutt.org>

	* main.c:

	* config.c, isync.1, isync.h, isyncrc.sample, main.c, sync.c:

	added `Delete' configuration option to force -d option

	sync_mailbox() didn't consider MaxSize == 0 to mean "unlimited".

	load_config() needs to print a newline in its error messages since
	next_arg() kills the newline of the line that was read out of the config
	file.

2001-10-03 00:01  Michael Elkins <me@mutt.org>

	* imap.c, sync.c:

	fixed maildir message filenames to comply with the maildir(5) specification.

	fixed write_strip() and imap_fetch_message() to check the return code of
	write() and fsync() to comply with maildir(5) spec.

2001-10-02 23:43  Michael Elkins <me@mutt.org>

	* main.c:

	the `Expunge' config directive didn't work since only the -e command line
	argument was consulted.

2001-10-02 22:46  Michael Elkins <me@mutt.org>

	* config.c, imap.c, isync.h:

	we should issue a CAPABILITY even if we aren't going to use ssl/tls so that
	cram-md5 auth still works.

2001-07-18 18:56  Michael Elkins <me@mutt.org>

	* config.c:

	find_box() should attempt to expand all filenames if none of the other
	methods found a match.

2001-07-18 18:49  Michael Elkins <me@mutt.org>

	* config.c, isync.h, maildir.c:

	fixed to not expand filenames until they are used inside of maildir_open(),
	so that aliases are not required for simple filenames.
	[re: http://bugs.debian.org/102255]

2001-06-22 23:30  Michael Elkins <me@mutt.org>

	* main.c:

	--host option didn't check for imaps: prefix

2001-06-21 20:45  Michael Elkins <me@mutt.org>

	* main.c:

	fixed core when specifying multiple mailboxes on the command line

2001-06-18 21:38  Michael Elkins <me@mutt.org>

	* configure.in, imap.c, isync.1:

	handle untagged responses in imap_fetch_message() so that it doesn't bomb
	out if new mail arrives while in the process of downloading

	noted in BUGS section of man page that if new mail arrives after the initial
	message list has been retrieved from the IMAP server, that new mail will not
	be fetched until the next invocation of isync.

2001-06-18 17:49  Michael Elkins <me@mutt.org>

	* config.c, imap.c, isync.h, main.c:

	isync should continue to process additional mailboxes even if there is an
	error with a previous mailbox.

	added -a (--all) flag to synchronize all mailboxes defined in ~/.isyncrc

2001-02-28 01:02  Michael Elkins <me@mutt.org>

	* config.c, imap.c:

	fixed compiler warnings under Solaris 2.7

2001-02-19 18:44  Michael Elkins <me@mutt.org>

	* cram.c, imap.c, maildir.c:

	rfc2595 compliance patch from Daniel Resare <noa@metamatrix.se>
		- CAPABILITY should be reissued after starting TLS since the
		  previous call was not protected

2001-02-14 20:46  Michael Elkins <me@mutt.org>

	* config.c, imap.c, isync.1, main.c, sync.c:

	patch from Daniel Resare <noa@metamatrix.se>:
	1 giving a path to a nonexistant rc-file with the -c argument dumps core

	  The patch adds a check to ensure that the given rc-file is accessible

	2 the error messages given from failed openssl calls are bogus

	  The handles the error from SSL_connect () correctly. The bug is
	  understndable since the error handling in openssl is quite obfuscated.
	  Good news is that the documentation manapges has been greatly updated in
	  the latest version (0.9.6). See in particular err(3), ERR_get_error(3)
	  and SSL_get_error(3).

	  Please note that possible SSL_ERROR_SSL type errors from SSL_read() and
	  SSL_write() is not handled. This should also be fixed.

	3 connecting using the STARTTLS command with an imap server that is
	  configured only to accept the TLSv1 protocol gives an error because isync
	  sends an SSLv2 Hello message for backwards compability. (This is the case
	  with the uw-imap 2000 that ships with redhat-7.0)
	  I've read RFC2595 several times to see if it says something about
	  compability SSL2/SSL3 hello messages but can't find anything. IMHO the
	  correct thing to do is change the default to not use SSL2/3 compability
	  hello when using the STARTTLS command but use it if the imaps port is
	  used. The patch implements this change

	4 repeated calls to SSL_CTX_set_options overwrites the old settings (the
	  values needs to be ORed together)

	  fixed in the patch

	patch from me@mutt.org:
		\Recent messages were put in the cur/ directory instead of new/

		give error message when the LOGIN command fails

2001-02-01 23:35  Michael Elkins <me@mutt.org>

	* imap.c:

	patch from Daniel Resare <noa@metamatrix.se>
