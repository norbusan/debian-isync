isync (0.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  IMPORTANT upgrade note:

  This version includes a change to the way the UID for each message is
  stored in the local mailbox. You need to remove all the messages in your
  local folder if you were previously using another version of isync or else
  you will end up with duplicate messages on your IMAP server. 

  A suggested upgrade procedure is to use isync version 0.7 to synchronize
  any local changes in isync-managed mailboxes with your IMAP server, and
  then remove the contents of the local mailboxes, before upgrading to this
  version. Then run isync again to pull down the mail again. You must do
  this manually, the Debian package will not do this for you.
