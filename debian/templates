_Description: isync won't refetch locally deleted messages
 Versions of isync older than 1.0 used to refetch messages that were
 locally deleted. Although it was a bug, some people may be using it
 as a feature. Since 1.0, messages that are locally deleted will be
 deleted remotely as well. People expecting the old buggy behavior
 will experience data loss.
