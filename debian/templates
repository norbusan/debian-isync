_Description: isync won't refetch messages deleted locally
 Before version 1.0, isync refetched messages that were deleted
 locally.  Some users may rely on that bug.  Since 1.0, messages that
 are deleted locally will be deleted remotely as well - they will not
 be refetched.  Anyone expecting the old buggy behavior may lose data.
