_Description: Abort isync upgrade
 You are upgrading from an older version of isync that stored the UID of
 each message in a way that is not compatable with the new version. You
 need to remove all the messages in local folders downloaded with the old
 version of isync. Otherwise isync will get confused and upload duplicate
 messages to the IMAP server.
 .
 A suggested upgrade procedure is to use the isync version 0.7 to
 synchronize any local changes in isync-managed mailboxes with your IMAP
 server (if there are any local changes to synchronise), and then remove
 the contents of the local mailboxes, before upgrading to version 0.8 or
 above. Then run isync again to pull down the mail again. You must do this
 manually; the Debian package will not do this for you.
 .
 If you want, the upgrade of isync can be aborted to let you deal with this
 issue. Or you can just suspend the upgrade or switch to a different
 virtual console to take care of it. Do not continue past this point before
 manually resolving this issue!
