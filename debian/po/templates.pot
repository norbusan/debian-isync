#
#    Translators, if you are not familiar with the PO format, gettext
#    documentation is worth reading, especially sections dedicated to
#    this format, e.g. by running:
#         info -n '(gettext)PO Files'
#         info -n '(gettext)Header Entry'
#
#    Some information specific to po-debconf are available at
#            /usr/share/doc/po-debconf/README-trans
#         or http://www.debian.org/intl/l10n/po-debconf/README-trans
#
#    Developers do not need to manually edit POT or PO files.

msgid ""
"You are upgrading from an older version of isync that stored the UID of each "
"message in a way that is not compatable with the new version. You need to "
"remove all the messages in local folders downloaded with the old version of "
"isync. Otherwise isync will get confused and upload duplicate messages to "
"the IMAP server."

#. Description

msgid ""
"A suggested upgrade procedure is to use the isync version 0.7 to synchronize "
"any local changes in isync-managed mailboxes with your IMAP server (if there "
"are any local changes to synchronise), and then remove the contents of the "
"local mailboxes, before upgrading to version 0.8 or above. Then run isync "
"again to pull down the mail again. You must do this manually; the Debian "
"package will not do this for you."

"If you want, the upgrade of isync can be aborted to let you deal with this "
"issue. Or you can just suspend the upgrade or switch to a different virtual "
"console to take care of it. Do not continue past this point before manually "
"resolving this issue!"
