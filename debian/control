Description: Synchronize a local maildir with a remote IMAP4 mailbox
 Command line applications which synchronize a local maildir-style
 mailbox with a remote IMAP4 mailbox, suitable for use in disconnected
 mode. Multiple copies of the remote IMAP4 mailbox can be maintained,
 and all flags and messages are synchronized.
 .
 The main application was much improved in version 1.0. Those
 improvements lead to interface changes and the application being
 renamed to mbsync. The application isync is now only a wrapper to
 keep compatibility with earlier versions.
