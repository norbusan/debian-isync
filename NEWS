[0.9]

Added Tunnel directive to allow the user to specify a shell command to run
to set up an IMAP connection in place of a TCP socket (eg., to run over
an SSH session).

Added PREAUTH support (useful mostly in conjunction with Tunnel).

Messages marked deleted are not uploaded when we are going to expunge.

Locally generated messages are not re-fetched after uploading even if the
UIDPLUS extension is not supported by the server.

Added `OneToOne' configuration option: ignore any Mailbox specifications
and instead pick up all mailboxes from the local MailDir and remote Folder
and map them 1:1 onto each other according to their names.

-C now creates both local and remote boxes; -L and -R create only local/remote.

--quiet is now really quiet.

!!! IMPORTANT !!!

In order to fix the problem where messages copied from one mailbox to
another were not uploaded to the new mailbox, the way Isync stores the UID
for each message needed to be changed.  As a result, you _MUST_ delete all
the messages in the local maildir box before using this version.  Otherwise
it will upload every message to the server thinking its a new mail.

[0.7]

Added `MaxMessages' configuration option to allow tracking of only the most
recently added message in the local mailbox.

Added --create (-C) command line option to force creation of the local
maildir-style mailbox if it doesn't already exist.

[0.6]

Added `Delete' configuration option to correspond to the -d command line
option.

Added -a (--all) command line option to synchronize all mailboxes.

[0.5]

Updated SSL support.

Added CRAM authentication support.

Added MailDir configuration option to specify the default location of local
mailboxes when relative paths are used.

Added support for uploading local messages to the IMAP server.

Added CopyDeletedTo configuration option to cause isync to move deleted
messages to a particular mailbox on the server when they are expunged.

[0.4]

Added MaxSize configuration option to limit downloading of new messages from
the server to less than some threshold.

More robust --fast option works without using \Recent flags, so the previous
problem with multiple accesses killing these flags is no longer a problem.

RFC2060 obsoleted RFC822.PEEK, use BODY.PEEK[] instead which does the same
job.

Don't need to request UID in a FETCH when doing UID FETCH (RFC2060 states
that its automatically returned).

[0.3]

Fixed to clean up temp maildir files when the fetch of a new message failed.

Fixed to not assume order of the flags returned by "UID FETCH"

Added support for building RPMs.

[0.2]

SSL support added.

[0.1]

Initial release.
