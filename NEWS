[0.7]

Added `MaxMessages' configuration option to allow tracking of only the most
recently added message in the local mailbox.

Added --create (-C) command line option to force creation of the local
maildir-style mailbox if it doesn't already exist.

[0.6]

Added `Delete' configuration option to correspond to the -d command line
option.

Added -a (--all) command line option to synchronize all mailboxes.

[0.5]

Updated SSL support.

Added CRAM authentication support.

Added MailDir configuration option to specify the default location of local
mailboxes when relative paths are used.

Added support for uploading local messages to the IMAP server.

Added CopyDeletedTo configuration option to cause isync to move deleted
messages to a particular mailbox on the server when they are expunged.

[0.4]

Added MaxSize configuration option to limit downloading of new messages from
the server to less than some threshold.

More robust --fast option works without using \Recent flags, so the previous
problem with multiple accesses killing these flags is no longer a problem.

RFC2060 obsoleted RFC822.PEEK, use BODY.PEEK[] instead which does the same
job.

Don't need to request UID in a FETCH when doing UID FETCH (RFC2060 states
that its automatically returned).

Fixed to not assume order of the flags returned by "UID FETCH"
